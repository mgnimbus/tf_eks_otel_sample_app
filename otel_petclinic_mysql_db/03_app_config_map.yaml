# CONFIG MAP
# 1. A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in 
# key-value pairs. 

# 2. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as 
## 2.1: environment variables, 
## 2.2: command-line arguments, 
## 2.3: or as configuration files in a volume. We are going to use this in our MySQL Deployment)
